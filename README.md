# Pong Game

This is a simple Pong game implemented in Python using the turtle graphics module.

## Description

Pong is a classic arcade game where two players compete against each other in a simulated table tennis match. The objective is to maneuver the paddles and hit the ball, aiming to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

The game features two paddles controlled by the players, a ball that moves across the screen, and a scoreboard to track the players' scores.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
2. Player 1 controls the left paddle using the "W" and "S" keys.
3. Player 2 controls the right paddle using the up and down arrow keys.
4. Hit the ball with your paddle to make it pass the opponent's paddle.
5. Each time the ball passes the opponent's paddle, you score a point.
6. The game ends when one player reaches the specified score limit.
7. After the game ends, the final score is displayed.

## Dependencies

The game requires the `turtle` module, which is a part of the Python standard library. No additional installations are needed.
